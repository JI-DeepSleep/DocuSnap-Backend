# DocuSnap-Backend Architecture Analysis

Welcome to the DocuSnap-Backend System Architecture Analysis documentation. This document provides a detailed analysis of the DocuSnap-Backend system architecture, technology stack, core modules, data flow, and deployment architecture, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system design and implementation.

## Document Overview

This documentation is based on an in-depth analysis of the [DocuSnap-Backend](https://github.com/JI-DeepSleep/DocuSnap-Backend) codebase and includes the following main sections:

- **Project Overview**: Introduction to the project background, target users, and core features
- **Technology Stack**: Details of the technologies and frameworks used in the system, along with selection rationale
- **Architecture Design**: Analysis of the overall architectural style, layered structure, and component relationships
- **Core Modules**: In-depth analysis of the system's five core functional modules
- **Typical Workflows**: Illustration of key business process data flows and processing steps
- **Code Quality**: Assessment of code quality, design pattern application, and improvement suggestions
- **Deployment Architecture**: Description of production environment deployment plans and technology stack
- **Conclusions & Recommendations**: Quick start guide and optimization directions

## System Overview

DocuSnap-Backend is a Flask-based backend service for OCR recognition and AI analysis of documents and forms. The system employs a three-layer architecture: backend server, OCR server, and LLM provider. The main features include:

1. **Document Processing**: Converting document images to structured text
2. **Form Processing**: Extracting fields and values from form images
3. **Form Auto-filling**: Automatically filling forms based on existing information

The system protects data transmission security through end-to-end encryption, improves concurrency through asynchronous task processing, and optimizes response speed for repeated requests using a caching mechanism.

## Core Features

- **Three-layer Architecture**: Backend server, OCR server, and LLM provider
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Using task queues and worker threads to handle time-consuming operations
- **End-to-end Encryption**: Using RSA and AES hybrid encryption to protect data security
- **Caching Mechanism**: Using SQLite to store task status and results
- **Design Patterns**: Applying various design patterns such as producer-consumer, strategy, and proxy
