**Deployment Steps**:
1. Install necessary dependencies (Python, Flask, SQLite, etc.)
2. Clone the repository and configure the environment
3. Start the Flask application and OCR service
4. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy (optional)

### 2. Distributed Deployment

Suitable for production environments and large-scale usage scenarios.

**Characteristics**:
- Components distributed across multiple servers
- Can scale each component independently
- Improves system reliability and fault tolerance
- Suitable for high concurrency, high load scenarios

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Deploy load balancing layer (Nginx)
2. Deploy multiple application service instances
3. Deploy multiple OCR service instances
4. Configure data storage layer
5. Configure external service connections

### 3. Containerized Deployment

Using container technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes for deployment.

**Characteristics**:
- Environment consistency and isolation
- Facilitates automated deployment and scaling
- High resource utilization
- Suitable for cloud environments and microservice architectures

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Create Docker images (application service, OCR service)
2. Write Docker Compose or Kubernetes configurations
3. Deploy container orchestration system
4. Configure service discovery and load balancing

### Network Security

**Recommended Configuration**:
- Enable HTTPS, using TLS 1.2+
- Configure appropriate CORS policies
- Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Implement IP restrictions and access controls
- Regularly update security patches

## Scalability Considerations

The DocuSnap-Backend system design supports both horizontal and vertical scaling:

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Application Service Layer**:
  - Increase the number of application service instances
  - Use load balancing to distribute requests
  - Stateless design facilitates scaling

- **OCR Service Layer**:
  - Increase the number of OCR service instances
  - Use load balancing to distribute requests
  - Can be scaled on demand

### Vertical Scaling

- **Increase Single Machine Resources**:
  - Upgrade CPU, memory, and storage
  - Suitable for low to medium load scenarios
  - Simple to implement, but limited scalability

### Database Scaling

- **SQLite Limitations**:
  - Suitable for small to medium-scale deployments
  - Limited concurrent write performance
  - Does not support distributed deployment

- **Upgrade to PostgreSQL** (recommended for large-scale deployments):
  - Supports high concurrent read and write operations
  - Supports master-slave replication and sharding
  - Better data management and backup mechanisms

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Monitoring Metrics

**System Metrics**:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O
- Network traffic

**Application Metrics**:
- Request response time
- Request success rate
- Task queue length
- Task processing time
- OCR and LLM service response times

### Log Management

**Log Types**:
- Application logs
- Access logs
- Error logs
- Security logs

**Log Configuration**:
- Use structured log formats (such as JSON)
- Configure appropriate log levels
- Implement log rotation policies
- Consider using centralized log management systems (such as ELK stack)

### Backup Strategy

**Backup Content**:
- Database files
- Configuration files
- Key files
- Application code

**Backup Frequency**:
- Database: Daily incremental backups, weekly full backups
- Configuration and keys: Backup after each modification
- Application code: Backup before each deployment
