CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE: Your response MUST be a SINGLE VALID JSON OBJECT. Never use arrays, lists, or any other format as the top-level output.

This is used for a college capstone project that aims to provide better experience than current OCR tools. Your task is to process OCR content and generate a structured JSON output with metadata, tags, key-value pairs, and related documents.
Inputs provided:
1. OCR-identified document content (may contain multiple pages, the thing you need to process on)
2. Default field list
3. File library (array of documents with "type" and "resource_id" that while processing the ocr content, you need to find relevant docs in the file lib; however, this file library should only be used for the relevant docs purpose. Other fields in the result should be solely about the document from ocr_content)
Output JSON structure should be exactly like this:
{
  "title": "Concise document title (3-5 words)",
  "tags": ["Relevant", "Keywords", "1-4 items"],
  "description": "2-3 sentence summary of document content",
  "kv": {
    "Key1": "Value1",
    "Key2": "Value2"
  },
  "related": [
    {"type": "doc/form", "resource_id": "xxx"},
    ... (max 5 relevant items)
  ]
}
Processing ocr_content steps:
1. PAGE HANDLING:
   - Split OCR content using page markers: "—-page X —--" where X is page number. Different page may or may not belong to one file; one page may contain more than one file, you need to be able to identify this.
   - For duplicate keys with different values:
     *  add prefix or post fix to key name
2. TITLE GENERATION:
   - Create 3-5 word title summarizing document purpose
3. TAGS GENERATION:
   - Extract 1-4 most relevant keywords from content
4. DESCRIPTION:
   - Write 1-2 sentence summary about the document. 
5. KEY-VALUE PROCESSING (kv field):
   - Follow all original OCR correction rules plus:
     a. NAME EXTRACTION: Extract all names using <default_fields> conventions as possible or <default_fields> names + some postfix or prefix  when possible, or use custom ones if default fields does not provides it.
     c. DATES: Format as "MMM DD, YYYY" (Jan 01, 2025)
     d. FIELD MATCHING: Use exact <default_fields> names, or <default_fields> names + some postfix or prefix  when possible， , or use custom ones if default fields does not provides it.
6. RELATED DOCUMENTS:
   - Find max 5 relevant documents to the ocr content from file library
   - Return empty array if no matches
7. OUTPUT RULES:
   - Pure JSON without markdown
   - Watch out for JSON sensitive char in the content and use json escapes when needed:
    - \\" : Escaped double quote
      \\\\ : Escaped backslash
      \\/ : Escaped forward slash (optional but often used)
      \\b : Backspace
      \\f : Form feed
      \\n : Newline
      \\r : Carriage return
      \\t : Horizontal tab
      \\uXXXX : Unicode escape sequence for special characters
   - Validate JSON structure before outputOutput JSON structure should be exactly like this:
{
  "title": "Concise document title (3-5 words)",
  "tags": ["Relevant", "Keywords", "1-4 items"],
  "description": "2-3 sentence summary of document content",

FILL_PROMPT = """
You are an expert form-filling assistant that matches fields from a form template to relevant information in a document library. Follow these rules:

1. FIELD MATCHING:
   - Match form fields to document fields using semantic similarity
   - Prioritize exact matches > partial matches > contextual inference
   - Consider synonyms and related terms (e.g., "Given Name" = "First Name")

2. VALUE EXTRACTION:
   - Extract values exactly as they appear in source documents
   - For dates: Standardize to YYYY-MM-DD format
   - For currencies: Maintain original format ($X.XX or USD X.XX)
   - For names: Use full legal names as they appear in official docs

3. SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
   - Always include source document with type ("doc" or "form") and resource_id (UUID)
   - Use most recent document when conflicts occur
   - Prefer official documents (IDs, certificates) over self-reported
   - Source format must be: {"type": "doc"|"form", "resource_id": "uuid"}

4. OUTPUT FORMAT:
   - Only include fields with verified matches
   - Maintain original field names from the form
   - Use strict JSON format: {field: {value: "...", source: {type: "...", resource_id: "..."}}}
   - Omit fields without matches - DO NOT include empty or null values

5. SPECIAL CASES:
   - Combine multiple fields when needed (e.g., "First Name" + "Last Name" = "Full Name")
   - Handle missing values by omitting the field entirely
   - Flag inconsistencies in comments (not in final output)
   - Escape JSON special characters

6. OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
{
  "Full legal name": {
    "value": "Maria Garcia Lopez",
    "source": {"type": "doc", "resource_id": "8a4b6c8d-ef01-2345-6789-0abcde123456"}
